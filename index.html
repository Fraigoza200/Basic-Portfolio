                I was born and raised in Santa Ana. I am a proud first generation Mexican. My parents come from Jalisco, Mexico. 
                Getting into the coding program at UCI is very humbling. The campus is very beautiful, and has a way to uplift me. Although I just 
                started coding, I am confident that i'll be an exceptional programmer. Aside from coding, I am apart of a Olympic weightlifting club.
                It is called Academy of weightlifting. Olympic weightlifting is composed of two lifts, Snatch, and Clean and Jerk. Snatch is a single 
                more technique based movement. Clean and Jerk is a dual movement lift that is not as technique based as the snatch, but it 
                is difficult when more weight is added. I am very fortunate to be given the liberty to lift with future Olympians.
